# Overland GPS Tracker for Android

GPS logger for Android devices

This app is based on the app Overland for iOS developped by Aaron Parecki https://github.com/aaronpk/Overland-iOS

 It is an experiment at gathering data from an Android device to test the Core Location API of Android and its various settings.

 The app tracks:

* GPS location
* Motion State (walking, running, driving, cycling, stationary)
* Battery level
* Wifi access point (only name)

The app gathers data with no network connection and stores locally on the device. The data is sent to the server in a batch at an interval set by the user.

There are many settings available in the settings tab which allow you to adjust properties of the Core Location API.
